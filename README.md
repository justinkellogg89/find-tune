## DESCRIPTION

### Music Playlist Generator is a web page that will take a userâ€™s input of a music artist and randomly select a pre-determined number of songs from that artist and populate them on a page.

## RESOURCES PLANNED FOR USE

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery

### Deezer API

### Bulma

## GOALS

### Our ultimate goal is to maintain the functionality above but be able to search by genre and populate songs that way. Additionally implementing a way to play the full song directly from the page is a goal we share.
