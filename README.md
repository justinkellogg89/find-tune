## DESCRIPTION

### Music Playlist Generator is a web page that will take a userâ€™s input of a music artist and randomly select a pre-determined number of songs from that artist and populate them on a page.

### Upon opening the page, the user will be greeted with a heading of the name of the application and a search bar with a search button next to it. The user can input any artist, and click the submit button or press 'enter'. Upon the submission, we have setup an AJAX call that is being sent to Deezer API and will return 10 random songs from the artist the user inputted as long as that artist is present in the API. Additionally, when the user requests an artist, there is another AJAX call that will go to GIPHY API and post a random GIF on the search results related to the artist they searched.

## RESOURCES PLANNED FOR USE

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery

### Deezer API

### GIPHY API

### Bulma

## GOALS

### Our ultimate goal is to maintain the functionality above but be able to search by genre and populate songs that way. Additionally implementing a way to play the full song directly from the page is a goal we share.
